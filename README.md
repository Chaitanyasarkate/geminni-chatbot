# geminni-chatbot
This project implements a simple web-based chatbot interface powered by Google's Gemini AI model.  It allows users to send text messages to the AI and receive responses in a chat-like format. The application is built using Flask (a Python web framework) for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
